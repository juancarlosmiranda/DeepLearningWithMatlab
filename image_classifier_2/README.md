Based on Mathworks Tutorial "Classify Webcam Images Using Deep Learning"
https://es.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/classify-images-from-webcam-using-deep-learning.html?s_tid=srchtitle

This is a real time object classifier.
Takes images from camera and show a predicted label.

A simple demo to traing a neural network.
Use this neural network to recognize flowers with a camera.

Connect your webcam, this was tested with Longitech Webcam 720.
You can test with some images from the dataset.

1. -Configure folders in ConfigData.m, put there path to models and dataset
2. -Run TrasnferLearning2.m to train a new neural network.
3.- Run ClassifierMainDL.Main() to execute loop.
